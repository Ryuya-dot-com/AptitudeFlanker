# AptitudeFlanker

The flanker task was created by Eriksen and Eriksen (1974) as a psychological task. In this task, a target stimulus is displayed in the center, surrounded by non-target stimuli. Participants need to press the left or right arrow key based on the direction of the target. The flanker task is designed to measure the effect of irrelevant stimuli on responses.

## Purpose of the Task

The primary goal of the flanker task is to measure participants’ ability to suppress irrelevant information and select the appropriate response. Specifically, it evaluates how irrelevant stimuli influence the target stimulus. The task observes how reaction times and accuracy change when irrelevant stimuli require the same response as the target (congruent stimuli) versus when they require a different response (incongruent stimuli).

## Procedure in the Flanker Task:

* Stimulus Presentation: The target stimulus (e.g., an arrow) is displayed in the center, with flankers (irrelevant stimuli) positioned on both sides.
* Response: Participants press a key based on the direction of the target. For instance, if the central arrow points left, the left arrow key should be pressed. In my code, the left arrow corresponds to the “F” key, and the right arrow corresponds to the “J” key.
* Conditions: There are two conditions:
  * Congruent condition: The target and flankers require the same response.
  * Incongruent condition: The target and flankers require different responses.

## Significance of the Task

The flanker task is used to understand the mechanisms of inhibitory control in working memory.
